MSc Project Code

Data availability
All data used in this study was download from the IMGT, PyIgClassify and PDBsum websites and can be found at: http://www.imgt.org/ and http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/PyIgClassify/default.aspx and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=index.html respectively.

Code Availability
All custom scripts are written in Python 3 and are available open source in the MSc Project repository at https://github.com/ruchira0103/MSc-Project
The GitHub page is a collection of Python scripts intended to be used for this project to gain an understanding of the IGHV1-69 germline. The end goal is to facilitate the interpretation of potential germline variability.
The scripts do have some amount of overlap; however, it should run smoothly once everything is saved in the same folder when downloading the scripts.

Dependencies
It is all written in Python 3 – the scripts rely on Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib for visualization.
